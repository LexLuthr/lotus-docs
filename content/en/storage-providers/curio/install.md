## Linux

You can build the Curio executables from source by following these steps.

### Software dependencies

You will need the following software installed to install and run Curio.

### System-specific

Building Curio requires some system dependencies, usually provided by your distribution.

Arch:

```shell
sudo pacman -Syu opencl-icd-loader gcc git bzr jq pkg-config opencl-icd-loader opencl-headers opencl-nvidia hwloc
```

Ubuntu/Debian:

```shell
sudo apt install mesa-opencl-icd ocl-icd-opencl-dev gcc git bzr jq pkg-config curl clang build-essential hwloc libhwloc-dev wget -y && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

Fedora:

```shell
sudo dnf -y install gcc make git bzr jq pkgconfig mesa-libOpenCL mesa-libOpenCL-devel opencl-headers ocl-icd ocl-icd-devel clang llvm wget hwloc hwloc-devel
```

OpenSUSE:

```shell
sudo zypper in gcc git jq make libOpenCL1 opencl-headers ocl-icd-devel clang llvm hwloc && sudo ln -s /usr/lib64/libOpenCL.so.1 /usr/lib64/libOpenCL.so
```

Amazon Linux 2:

```shell
sudo yum install -y https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm; sudo yum install -y git gcc bzr jq pkgconfig clang llvm mesa-libGL-devel opencl-headers ocl-icd ocl-icd-devel hwloc-devel
```

### Rustup

Curio needs [rustup](https://rustup.rs). The easiest way to install it is:

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### Go

To build Curio, you need a working installation of [Go 1.21.7 or higher](https://golang.org/dl/):

```shell
wget -c https://golang.org/dl/go1.21.7.linux-amd64.tar.gz -O - | sudo tar -xz -C /usr/local
```

{{< alert icon="tip">}}
You'll need to add `/usr/local/go/bin` to your path. For most Linux distributions you can run something like:

```shell
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin' >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
```

See the [official Golang installation instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install) if you get stuck.
{{< /alert >}}

## System Configuration

Before you proceed with the installation, you should increase the UDP buffer. You can do this by running the following commands:

```shell
sudo sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=2097152
sudo sysctl -w net.core.rmem_default=2097152
```

### Build and install Curio

Once all the dependencies are installed, you can build and install Curio.

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus.git
   cd lotus/
   ```

2. Switch to the latest stable release branch:

    ```shell
    git checkout master
    ```

3. Depending on your CPU model, you will want to export additional environment variables:

   a. If you have **an AMD Zen or Intel Ice Lake CPU (or later)**, enable the use of SHA extensions by adding these two environment variables:

    ```shell
    export RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native -g"
    export FFI_BUILD_FROM_SOURCE=1
    ```

   See the [Native Filecoin FFI section](#native-filecoin-ffi) for more details about this process.

   a. Some older Intel and AMD processors without the ADX instruction support may panic with illegal instruction errors. To solve this, add the `CGO_CFLAGS` environment variable:

    ```shell
    export CGO_CFLAGS_ALLOW="-D__BLST_PORTABLE__"
    export CGO_CFLAGS="-D__BLST_PORTABLE__"
    ```

   a. By default, a 'multicore-sdr' option is used in the proofs library.  This feature is also used in FFI unless explicitly disabled.  To disable building with the 'multicore-sdr' dependency, set `FFI_USE_MULTICORE_SDR` to `0`:

    ```shell
    export FFI_USE_MULTICORE_SDR=0
    ```

4. Build and install Curio

   Curio is compiled to operate on a single network.

   Choose the network you want to join, then run the corresponding command to build the Curio node:

   ```shell
   # For Mainnet:
   make clean build

   # For Calibration Testnet:
   make clean calibnet
   ```
   Install Curio:
   ```shell
   sudo make install
   ```

   This will put `curio` in `/usr/local/bin`.

   `curio` will use the `$HOME/.curio` folder by default.

   ```shell
   curio --version
   ```
   ```
   curio version 1.23.3+mainnet+git.7bb1f98ac
   # or
   curio version 1.23.3+calibnet+git.7bb1f98ac
   ```
   TODO: Fix this

5. You should now have Curio installed. You can now [finish setting up the Curio node]({{< relref "setup" >}}).

### Native Filecoin FFI

Some newer CPU architectures like AMD's Zen and Intel's Ice Lake have support for SHA extensions. Having these extensions enabled significantly speeds up your Curio node. To make full use of your processor's capabilities, make sure you set the following variables **before building from source**:

```shell
export RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native -g"
export FFI_BUILD_FROM_SOURCE=1
```

This method of building does not produce portable binaries. Make sure you run the binary on the same computer as you built it.

# MacOS

## Build from source

You can build the Curio executables from source by following these steps.

### Software dependencies

You must have XCode and Homebrew installed to build Curio from source.

#### XCode Command Line Tools

Curio requires that X-Code CLI tools be installed before building the Curio binaries.

1. Check if you already have the XCode Command Line Tools installed via the CLI, run:

    ```shell
    xcode-select -p
    ```

   This should output something like:

    ```plaintext
    /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
    ```

   If this command returns a path, then you have Xcode already installed! You can [move on to installing dependencies with Homebrew](#homebrew). If the above command doesn't return a path, install Xcode:

    ```shell
    xcode-select --install
    ```

Next up is installing Curio's dependencies using Homebrew.

#### Homebrew

We recommend that macOS users use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) to install each of the necessary packages.

1. Use the command `brew install` to install the following packages:

   ```shell
   brew install go bzr jq pkg-config hwloc coreutils
   ```

Next up is cloning the Lotus repository and building the executables.

#### Rust

Rustup is an installer for the systems programming language Rust. Run the installer and follow the onscreen prompts. The default installation option should be chosen unless you are familiar with customisation:

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### Build and install Curio

The installation instructions are different depending on which CPU is in your Mac:

- [M1-based CPUs](#m1-based-cpus)
- [Intel CPUs](#intel-cpus)

#### M1-based CPUs

1. Clone the repository:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus.git
    cd lotus/
    ```

2. Switch to the latest stable release branch:

    ```shell
    git checkout master
    ```

3. Create the necessary environment variables to allow Curio to run on M1 architecture:

    ```shell
    export LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/lib
    export FFI_BUILD_FROM_SOURCE=1
    export PATH="$(brew --prefix coreutils)/libexec/gnubin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
    ```

4. Build the `curio` binary:

    ```shell
    make clean curio
    ```

5. Run the final `make` command to move this `curio` executable to `/usr/local/bin`. This allows you to run `curio` from any directory.

    ```shell
    sudo make install
    ```

6. You should now have Curio installed. You can now set up a new Curio cluster or migrating from Lotus-Miner. TODO: Link

#### Intel CPUs

{{< alert icon="warning">}}
These instructions are for installing Curio on an Intel Mac. If you have an M1-based CPU, use the [M1-based CPU instructions â†‘](#m1-based-cpus)
{{< /alert >}}

1. Clone the repository:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus.git
    cd lotus/
    ```

2. Switch to the latest stable release branch:

    ```shell
    git checkout master
    ```

3. Build and install Curio:

    ```shell
    make clean curio
    sudo make install
    ```
   You can now [finish setting up the Curio node]({{< relref "setup" >}}).
